# 🤖 Puppeteer Starter Setup – Headless Automation Boilerplate (ESM)

This repository includes a basic setup and minimal boilerplate for working with **Puppeteer**, a Node.js library for controlling headless Chrome, using **ES Modules**.

> ⚠️ This is not a complete bot. It’s a **preparation project** that lays the groundwork for future automation using Puppeteer.  
> There are no site-specific scripts or tasks yet — this is the foundation.

## 📁 What’s Inside?

- Puppeteer installation and initialization
- Headless Chromium launch configuration
- ES Module syntax (`import`, `export`)
- Basic script structure for building bots later
- Commented placeholders for future automation logic

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Make Sure Your `package.json` Includes:

````json
{
  "type": "module"
}
This enables ES module syntax like import instead of require.

2. Install Dependencies
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
npm install puppeteer
3. Run the Script
bash
Kopyala
Düzenle
node app.js
🔧 Features
Launches a headless (or optionally visible) Chromium browser

ES Module-based structure

Pre-configured for future interaction with web pages

Includes placeholders for:

Page navigation

Element interaction

Delay simulation

🎯 Who Is This For?
Developers learning Puppeteer from scratch with ES Modules

Those setting up the groundwork for a browser bot

Anyone who wants a clean, modern starting point

❗ Note
This repo does not include actual automation logic for a specific website.
It is meant for learning and building upon, not for production use.
